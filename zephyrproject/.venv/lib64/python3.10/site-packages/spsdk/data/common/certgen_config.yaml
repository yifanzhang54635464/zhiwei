# Path, where issuer private key is stored
# If the issuer_private_key is encrypted, the interactive prompt will ask for password
# For loading the password in non-interactive way, the configuration parameter 'issuer_private_key_password' can be used.
# There are multiple formats of issuer_private_key_password values:
#   1. If the value is an existing path, first line of file is read and returned
#   2. If the value has format '$ENV_VAR', the value of environment variable ENV_VAR is returned
#   3. If the value has format '$ENV_VAR' and the value contains a valid path to a file, the first line of a file is returned
#   4. If the value does not match any options above, the input value itself is returned
